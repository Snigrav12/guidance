        <h1>Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur</h1>
         
        <h2>Dedicated To The Service Of Nation</h2>
        <p class="color">The motto of IIT Kharagpur is "योगः कर्मसु कौशलम्". This literally translates to "Excellence in action is Yoga", essentially implying that doing your work well is (true) yoga. This can be traced to Sri Krishna's discourse with Arjuna in the Bhagavad Gita. The quote, in the larger context of the Gita, urges man to acquire equanimity because a mind of equanimity allows a man to shed distracting thoughts of the effects of his deeds and concentrate on the task before him. Equanimity is the source of perfection in Karmic endeavours that leads to Salvation.</p>
